README for persona

The persona module was born out of the need to be able to easily specify which
subroutines of a module should be available (as in "compiled") in different
sets of mod_perl environments (e.g. the visitors front end web servers, or
the personnel's back-office web servers).  This both from a memory, database
and CPU usage point of view, as well as from the viewpoint of security.
