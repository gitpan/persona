0.05	25 January 2009
	Added code to have any errors in -require- be reported from the "right"
	location, to avoid code breakage by stupid core modules such as
	"base.pm" that seem to depend on specific call stack info when a
	-require- fails.

0.04	25 January 2009
	Removed dependency to non-core module List::MoreUtils.  Got so used
	to using that module that I incorrectly assumed it was core (well,
	maybe it should be ;-).  Spotted by Frank Wiegand.

0.03	25 January 2009
	Externalized parsing logic in "path2source" class method.

	Added -require- handler so that we can properly set the %INC setting
	of the processed file.  Adapted CAVEATS section accordingly.

	And more tests of course.

0.02	24 January 2009
	Changed the abstract.  Fixed some warnings.  Added a CAVEATS section.

0.01	23 January 2009
	First version of persona.pm.
